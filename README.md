# Classification of Satellite Images based on their Terrain Type

**Satellite image classification system:** The satellite image is partitioned into sub-images, which then are classified into four different terrain types: forest, city, desert, mountain, and water bodies.</p>

## Description

Satellite image classification and analysis has many important applications in the real world. For example, it can be used to track deforestation levels, glacier movements, or even the expansion of cities. We propose a satellite image analysis algorithm based on sub-image classification. The proposed algorithm can identify up to five different terrain types: forest city, desert, mountain and water bodies. We also compare the performance of five common classification algorithms and select the one with the highest accuracy for the task of satellite image analysis. This paper was written as part of the project for the course "MT0017 Mechatronics Topics: Machine Learning", taught by Oscar Ramos at UTEC.
